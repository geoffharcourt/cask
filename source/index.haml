    %li
      Cask is only ~84 lines of code so its basically fully knowable
    %li
      Because of its simplicity there is virtually no “where is this coming from!?”
    %li
      The syntax for media queries is greatly simplified
    %li
      There is no use of relative positioning or nth child selectors
    %li
      Cask is built around defining as few attributes as possible
    %li
      It’s easy to use in conjunction with flex-box

    Here’s the thing… There is no spoon.

    Just because your using a grid gramework doesn’t mean you have to use it for everything. If you need a variable, use a variable. If you need a calculation use a function. If you need a bunch more, then use a mixin. Cask is made to be usable with as little implimentation as possible. Here’s an example.
  %pre
    %code
      :preserve
        .foo {
          width: grid-calc(4); // Makes this 4 columns wide!
          padding: 0 $column-gutter; // Now it’s got padding just like a row + column!!
        }
